# Practical Git guide by Jorge Noriega

## Clone Repository to Local
  ### From Github using HTTP key
  ```
  git clone "http address here"
  ```
  ### From Bitbuket using SSH key
  ```
  git clone "ssh: key here"
  ```

## Create New Branch
```
git checkout -b my_branch
```

## Push Change to Remote Branch
```
git add .
git commit -m "add commit message here"
git push origin my_branch
```

## Switch to Master
```
git checkout master
```

## Merge my_branch into Master
```
git pull origin master
git merge origin my_branch
git push origin master
```

## Merge Master into my branch (when Master changes and branches diverge)
```
git merge origin master
```

## Delete Branch
  ### From my machine
  ```
  git branch -d my_branch
  ```
  ### From my repository
  ```
  git push -d origin jorge_branch
  ```


## Other Useful Commands
### Remove a file
```
git rm test_run.mat
```
### Logging changes
```
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
```
### Unstage a file
```
git reset "filename"
```
### Restore a file to last commit
```
git restore "filepath/filename"
```


### Handy git commands

git status : to determine the status of corrent repo
git log : to review the repo including SHA key for every commit
	use command 'q' to return back to terminal from log
git show: gives info about final commit
git diff: display difference between different versions of file. Very useful to see changes before committ
git rm --cached : very useful to remove added file before commiting
If: Another git process seems to be running in this repository...()
rm -f .git/index.lock
